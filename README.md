# Hacking the Incubator

One of our lab incubators is a relatively cheap (¥10,000 - ¥15,000) incubator, that can both heat & cool. It has a peltier device, a temp sensor, a fan for internal circulation and a fan to cool the peltier.
It's controlled by 4 buttons on the front (power, temp up, temp down, light).

You can get one from [here](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/VS-404-Versos-25L-Portable-Pack/dp/B00ADEHRL8/).

## Disassembly

We decided to open the incubator up and see how its made.
